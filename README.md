Hi Campk12, It's me Satyanchal Choudhary. I am very happy that you have organized Unocoder in which youth of India can show their talent. I have also participated in this and I made this flip-card-matching game. It took me about 8 days to make it, 3 days to make the frontend and 5 days to make the backend. But I am happy that this game is ready now.
